# The Three Owls

"The Three Owls" website is a personal project designed to explore the cultural and historical significance of the iconic owl symbols in Leeds, UK. These owls, deeply rooted in the city's heritage, symbolize wisdom, vigilance, and resilience. The site highlights three significant locations in Leeds where these owls are prominently featured:

1. **The Golden Owl on Leeds Civic Hall:** A notable landmark symbolizing the city's wisdom and vigilance.
  
2. **The Owls at Owl Corner:** Located near Leeds Town Hall, these owls continue the tradition of guardianship over the city.
  
3. **The Owl on the Central Library:** A longstanding symbol of knowledge and learning in Leeds.

The website narrates the history of these owls, tracing their origins back to the Savile family and their lasting impact on the city's identity. This project combines a passion for local history with the practical exercise of developing web content using Svelte.
